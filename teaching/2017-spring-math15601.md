Here is the [midterm]({{site.url}}/assets/teaching/2017-spring-math15601/midterm-sp17.pdf). It is due in class on April 5 by 11:30am. If you cannot make it to class that day, please drop it off in advance in my mailbox in the office, or scan your exam and email it to me. If you would like me to post your results before Apr 19, please add your EMPLID to the exam.

Here are the [midterm results]({{site.url}}/assets/teaching/2017-spring-math15601/midterm-results.pdf). Well done, everyone!

Here are the [solutions]({{site.url}}/assets/teaching/2017-spring-math15601/midtermsols-sp17.pdf) for the midterm.

Here are some [extra problems]({{site.url}}/assets/teaching/2017-spring-math15601/extraproblems.pdf) to practice for the final. I also strongly recommend that you redo all of the homework problems. Here are the [solutions]({{site.url}}/assets/teaching/2017-spring-math15601/extraproblems-sols.pdf).

The in-class final will be on **May 17**. Here is the [front page]({{site.url}}/assets/teaching/2017-spring-math15601/front-sp17.pdf) of the final with a fact sheet.

I will be holding extended office hours on Tuesday, May 16, between 2pm and 4pm. I will also be in the office on Wednesday, before the final.
