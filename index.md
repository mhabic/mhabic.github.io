Miha E. Habič is a mathematician interested in set theory, primarily forcing, large cardinals, and connections to computability theory. I also enjoy thinking about other topics in mathematical logic.

I am currently an assistant professor at [Bard College at Simon's Rock](https://simons-rock.edu/).

I completed my PhD in Mathematics with [Joel David Hamkins](http://jdh.hamkins.org/) at the Graduate Center, CUNY, in 2017.

Here is my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/cv.pdf).

Here you can track my activity on MathOverflow and MathStackexchange:
